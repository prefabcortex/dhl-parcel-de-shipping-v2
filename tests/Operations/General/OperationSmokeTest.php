/**
 * Every operation called once, against a client that records the request instead of sending it.
 *
 * Nothing leaves the process and no credentials are needed: PSR-18 is one method, so the client is
 * stood in for. What runs is everything up to the wire — the URI assembled, the query string
 * encoded, the body serialised. The client signs nothing.
 *
 * What is watched is the request: its method, and its path up to the first placeholder. These calls
 * go through the `…Raw()` methods, which hand the response back unparsed, so the canned answer
 * never has to match a status or content type from the description — an answer invented from that
 * document would say nothing about a client built from the same one.
